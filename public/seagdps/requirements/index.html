				<h3>Rate Requirements</h3>
				<h4>Base Requirements</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>If your level has a very good gameplay, but the deco isn't the best, it can still be rated higher. For example: a level with Feature worthy deco, but it's rated Epic because it has great gameplay.</li>
					<li>Longer levels get higher ratings, for example: "<strong>Our Time</strong>" by boxie.</li>
					<li>Creativity will give higher ratings. For example: "<strong>Last Life</strong>" by ProfWhizz. The background is pretty empty and the structuring is pretty odd, but it's very creative and well-made.</li>
					<li>Levels have to be at least <strong>15</strong> seconds.</li>
					<li>Levels must be verified.</li>
					<li>Levels should be consistent. Don't have one part be a 6 star but the next is an Extreme Demon. The same for deco: one part shouldn't be Feature and another is Mythic.</li>
					<li>If a level's gameplay is considered very bad by a large majority of players, the level won't be rated even if the deco is rate worthy.</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Each Rate Specific</h4>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Star Rate</strong> - The level needs to have some structuring. You can use simple 1.0 blocks or just solid blocks, the gameplay should be okay at least.</li>
					<li><strong>Feature</strong> - Your level needs to be at least 30 seconds long and have pretty decent deco and good gameplay, otherwise great gameplay with relatively simple deco. For example: "<strong>Teresa and Maria</strong>" by CrazyFlyKite.</li>
					<li><strong>Epic</strong> Your level needs be at least 30 seconds long and should have good deco with great gameplay. For example: "<strong>adrenaline</strong>" by SeaCarrrot.</li>
					<li><strong>Legendary</strong> - Your level needs to be at least 30 seconds and should have very good gameplay with excellent deco, and just overall a great level.</li>
					<li><strong>Mythic</strong> - Pretty self-explanatory. Your level needs to be at least 30 seconds long and just amazing overall. Most people should agree it's a very good level. Or it's a stupid joke level :3</li>
				</ul>
